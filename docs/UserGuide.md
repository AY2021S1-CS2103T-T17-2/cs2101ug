* Notes: Extra pointers that you would like to note down can be stored here. It will be together with the answer of the flashcard.
* Rating: Rating states the importance of the flashcard, from 1 to 5. This star rating is intended to follow the [CS2103 website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/website/admin/moduleExpectations.html). 
* Tag: Tags can be added to uniquely identify the flashcard (just like Twitter! 😊).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Notes about the command format
Feeling a little overwhelmed by the command format we use throughout the user guide? Fear not, as this section will guide you along the various command formats and notations we use throughout the user guide!


Format/Notation | Meaning
-----------|-----------------------
`QUESTION` | Words in uppercase are parameters that you should supply. <br> eg. in `add q/QUESTION`, `QUESTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add q/What is my name?`
`q/QUESTION` | The letter and slash before the parameter is the prefix. You should use this to separate the current parameter from other parameters.
`success` | Words in lowercase are to be specified exactly, meaning word for word. 
`<success|quiz>` | Items in angle brackets are either/or options. Each option is delineated by a `|`. <br> eg. `<success|quiz>` can be used as `success` or `quiz` but not both
`[c/CATEGORY]` | Items in square brackets are optional. You can choose whether you want to specify them. <br> eg. `q/QUESTION [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `q/What is my name? c/Name` or `q/What is my name?`
`[t/TAG]...` | Items with ellipsis after them can be used either multiple or zero times <br> eg. `t/TAG` can be used 0 times or as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, etc

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Parameters can be specified in any order. If the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, you can specify it as `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` as well.
</div> 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Common Input Fields

Many of our commands use the same input fields. This section will teach you what each of them means and how to specify them.
If you are reading this guide for the first time, you can skip to [Features](#features) first. You can refer back to this table at any time!

<br>

## Features

### Add a flashcard : `add`

Now let's get started. The first thing you would do in SWEe! is to, of course, add flashcards!

Format: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [c/CATEGORY] [r/RATING] [n/NOTE] [d/DIAGRAM] [t/TAG]...`

* Remember that the `QUESTION` and `ANSWER` fields are compulsory while adding a flashcard! The rest are optional.
(Hint: You can always add in the remaining fields subsequently using our [edit command](#edit-a-flashcard---edit)!)
* After a new flashcard is added, the flashcard list will update to include the new flashcard.
* If you are having troubles understanding the fields, feel free to refer to [common input fields](#common-input-fields) on what the different fields are and how to specify them.
* To understand how to add diagrams using relative file paths, refer to this [short tutorial](#finding-file-path-for-diagram-field).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: **Note**: If the category is not specified, the flashcard  will be assigned to the <b>General</b> category by default.

</div>

Examples:
* `add q/What does OOP stand for? a/Object Oriented Programming` adds a flashcard with only its compulsory fields, a question and an answer.
* `add q/What does OOP stand for? a/Object Oriented Programming r/3 t/cool` adds a flashcard containing a question, an answer, a rating and a tag.
* `add q/What does OOP stand for? a/Object Oriented Programming d/images/diagram.png` adds a flashcard containing a question, an answer and a diagram
by specifying its file path.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Steps for adding a flashcard**:

**Step 1**: In this case, we will use one of the add commands above as an example.
To add a flashcard, type the command `add q/What does OOP stand for? a/Object Oriented Programming r/3 t/cool` and press Enter.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_add_step1.png)

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_delete_step2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit a flashcard  : `edit`

Yes, we all make mistakes (and typos). Realised that you have a typo in your flashcard? Fret not, you can edit your flashcard details in SWEe! by specifying the fields you want to edit!

Format: `edit INDEX [q/QUESTION] [a/ANSWER] [c/CATEGORY] [n/NOTE] [r/RATING] [d/DIAGRAM] [t/TAG]...`

* Refer to [common input fields](#common-input-fields) on what the different fields are and how to specify them.
* A minimum of one field has to be given.
* To understand how to edit diagrams using relative file paths, refer to this [short tutorial](#finding-file-path-for-diagram-field).

Examples:

* `edit 3 q/What does OOP stand for? c/Acronyms` edits the 1st flashcard’s question and category to be "What does OOP stand for?" and "Acronyms" respectively.
* `edit 3 a/Object Oriented Programming t/OOP` edits the 3rd flashcard’s answer to "Object Oriented Programming" and tag to "OOP".
* `edit 3 n/Important question!` edits the 3rd flashcard’s notes.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Steps for editing a flashcard**:

**Step 1**: Locate the flashcard you wish to edit. In this example, we want to edit the first flashcard's question and category to "What does OOP stand for?" and "Acronyms" respectively. Type `edit 1 q/What does OOP stand for? c/Acronyms` into the command box and press Enter.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_edit_step1.PNG)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 2**: The result display will show a message that the flashcard has been edited successfully.

**Step 3**: The flashcard list will show the updated details of the flashcard after the edit.

### Filter for flashcards  : `filter`

Want to look at flashcards belonging to a certain category? Or look at flashcards with a rating of 5?
Filter command allows you to filter for specified flashcards based on your field inputs. 

Format: `filter [c/CATEGORY] [r/RATING] [f/<yes|no>] [t/TAG]...`

* Filters for specified flashcards based on category, rating, favourite status or tags.
* Specifying `f/yes` filters for favourited flashcards while `f/no` filters for unfavourited flashcards.
* Supports filtering of one or more different fields. For example:
    - `filter c/SDLC r/5` will filter out flashcards belonging to the SDLC category with a rating of 5.
* Although all fields are optional, a minimum of one field has to be given.
* If you are having troubles understanding the fields, feel free to refer to [common input fields](#common-input-fields) on what the different fields are and how to specify them.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:memo: **Note**: <code>filter r/</code> will filter for all unrated flashcards.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Want to list all your flashcards after using `filter`? Use the [list](#list-all-flashcards--list) command.

### Review flashcards: `review`

Want to study your flashcards? Our review mode lets you easily navigate freely between flashcards to study them so that you can ace your next exam!

Format: `review`

<br>

So what is review mode? Upon entering review mode, you can no longer input commands to the command box. However, the following keyboard input will now be recognised:

* `↓ key` shows the answer and notes of the current flashcard  
* `↑ key` hides the answer and notes of the current flashcard

![Review step 4](images/ug/ug_review_step4.png)

<br>

To summarise, when you are in review mode, use the `↓ key` and `↑ key` to toggle showing the flashcard’s answer and notes. Use the `→ key` and `← key` to move between flashcards. Use the `q key` to quit review mode.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Quiz flashcards: `quiz`

Want to revise for your upcoming exam? Our quiz mode simulates a mock exam to put your knowledge to the test and monitors how well you score.

Format: `quiz`

So what is quiz mode? Upon entering quiz mode, you can no longer input commands to the command box. However, the following keyboard input will now be recognised:
* `↓ key` shows the answer and notes of the current flashcard  
* `q` quits quiz mode
* `y` This input will only be recognised after the `↓ key` is pressed. `y` indicate a correct quiz attempt. 
* `n` This input will only be recognised after the `↓ key` is pressed. `n` indicates an incorrect quiz attempt. 

Quiz attempts are recorded and information about your scores can be displayed using the [stats](#view-the-statistics-of-flashcard--stats) command.


**Steps for entering quiz mode**:

**Step 1**: We want to enter quiz mode to test ourselves on the current list of flashcards. Type the command `quiz` and press Enter.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_quiz_step1.PNG)

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_quiz_step2.PNG)


**Step 3**: In this example, we will demonstrate the behaviour of the `↓ key`. Upon pressing the `↓ key`, the answer of the flashcard will be shown and we will be prompted if we got the answer correct.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_quiz_step3.PNG)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 4**: We got this answer correct so we will press `y`. This will automatically bring us to the next flashcard.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_quiz_step4.PNG)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort all flashcards : `sort`

Want to get an overview of how skilled you are at answering the flashcards? Our sort command is here to help you, with two important criteria that you can sort your flashcards by, namely the quiz frequency and success rate of your flashcards!

Format: `sort <success|quiz> <-a|-d>`

* Specifying `-a` means sorting by the criteria in ascending order.
* Specifying `-d` means sorting by the criteria in descending order.

Examples: 
* `sort success -a` sorts the flashcards according to success rate in ascending order.
* `sort success -d` sorts the flashcards according to success rate in descending order.
* `sort quiz -a` sorts the flashcards according to quiz frequency in ascending order.
* `sort quiz -d` sorts the flashcards according to quiz frequency in descending order.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** If you are confused about what quiz frequency and success rate mean, head over to our [FAQ](#faq) section to understand it more!
</div> 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Steps for sorting flashcards**:

**Step 1**: In this example, we want to sort the flashcards according to success rate in an ascending order. Type `sort success -a` into the command box and press Enter.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_sort_step1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 2**: The result display will show a message telling you that the flashcards have been sorted according to success rate in ascending order.

**Step 3**: The flashcard list will show the newly sorted list of flashcards according to the criteria.

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_sort_step2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View a flashcard  : `view`

The view command allows you to see your flashcards in detail. You will be able to see the full question on the flashcard and the diagram of the flashcard. Optionally, you can also choose to see the answer and notes of the flashcard.

Format: `view INDEX [-a]`

### View the statistics of flashcard : `stats`

Want to view the results of your attempts in quiz mode? The stats command simplifies your life by providing visual representations of the result.

Format: `stats INDEX`

Example:
* `stats 1` shows the statistics of the 1st flashcard in the displayed flashcard list on the view pane.

Using the `stats` command will show the following information in the view pane:

* Pie chart. This chart shows the percentage of correct attempts versus incorrect attempts.
* Total quiz attempts. This numerical value represents the total number of attempts in quiz mode.
* Correct attempts. This numerical value represents the total number of correct attempts in quiz mode.

### Finding file path for Diagram field
This short tutorial will be useful when adding or editing diagrams to flashcards.


**Step 1**: Locate the root folder containing the SWEe Jar file and navigate to it

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_diagram_path_step1.png) 

**Step 2**: Next, locate the relative file path of the image file. In this example, our diagram is located in the image folder.
Hence, the relative file path is `image/classDiagramExample1.png` 

![filedirectory](images/ug/ug_diagram_path_step2.png)

**Step 3**: Now, go ahead and add or edit your flashcard by adding `d/image/classDiagramExample1.png` after the appropriate command!

Examples of usages of the diagram field:
* `add q/Is this a class diagram? a/Yes d/image/classDiagramExample1.png`
*  `edit 1 d/image/classDiagramExample1.png`

Navigate back to [adding a flashcard](#add-a-flashcard--add) or navigate back to [editing a flashcard](#edit-a-flashcard---edit)
